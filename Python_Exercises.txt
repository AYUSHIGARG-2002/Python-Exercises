--Playing with BODMAS
1. Declare 5 variables
		int a = 21
		int b = 6
		int c = 3
		int d = 1
	1a. Print result of a - b / c
	1b. Print result of (a - b) / c
	1c. print result of a/b*c+d
	1d. print result of a/(b*(c+d))
2. Accept 5 variables from command prompt as paramter from Java program
		float a
		float b
		float c
		float d
		float e
	2a. Print result of ++a
	2b. Print result of a++
	2c. print result of (a++ + b++ ) / c++
	2d. print result of a/(b*(c + ++d))
	2e. Print result of a^b++ + b ^ ++c + c ^ --d + d ^ e--

3. Declare 5 variables as below
	float a = <put value>
	double b = <Put value> 
	byte c = <Put Value>
	short d = <Put Value>
	long e = <Put Value>
	
	short result = <Type cast it to short> e
	short result_2 = <type cast it to short> (c - e)
	short result_3 = <type cast it to short> e - a
	
	//Try other combinations of long to int, int to short, doublt to float, float to byte -- reducing.
	// Try other combination of int to long , short to long, float to double, byte to float -- expanding.
4. Simple Calculator using Switch Case Statements.

	1. Take two numbers (Example 10, 2).
	2. Accept operation to be carried out (a = addition, s = subtraction, m = multiplication, d = division
	
	With swith case statement perform any of these operations. 
	User should give numbers and operations.
--Loops
5. Using calculator from previous exercise (Step 4), keep performing operations in loop till end user wants.
	Add additional functionality to calculator
		1. Power 
		2. E^
		3. Modulo operator
		4. Trignometric functions.
6. Take inputs and build factorial functions.
	5! = 5x4x3x2x1

7. Using '*' and nested for loops print below shapes in Console
7a.
* * * * * * * *
7b.
* * * * * * * * 
*             *

8. Take 10 integers as input and add them to an integer array. Then write code find average of an Array.
9. Write a Java Program to take 10 input elements in any random order and sort the array and print elements of array in sorted (both ascending and descending) order.
10. Write a java program to store 10 elements in an array and search for the element in arrary.
11. Take a name of person and reverse the string. Find out if it is a palindrome.
12. write a java program to compare two array. There are two types of equalities, write code for both equalities.
	1. Numbers in arrary are same (irrespective of position).
	2. Both numbers in arrary and positions have to be same to be equal.
13. Write a java program to fill arrary of length with 100 elemements. Random integers will be filled in the arrary.
14. Write a java program to remove duplicates from the above array ( in step 13).
15. implement a stack data sturucture using array.
16. implement a queue data structure using array.
